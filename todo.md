1. Run inference of simulated trees under age_dependent_rates

2. Run inference of simulated trees under the type of rate shift

These are the outputs I want for the inference:
* Newick string
* N matrix (3-dim)
* Tip rates
* Branch rates CSV file
* Constant-rate Birth-Death Process estimates
* Estimate for \eta
