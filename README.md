## Empirical analyses

Diversification analyses for large empirical phylogenies done with [Pesto](https://github.com/kopperud/Pesto.jl)

The google sheets with the metadata for the empirical phylogenies are here [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-kAEmXYLukalWeBeU0p5S_UMKltX8IZEqgZ4L_95xiw/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-kAEmXYLukalWeBeU0p5S_UMKltX8IZEqgZ4L_95xiw/edit#gid=0) 

The sheet can be downloaded in the menu by clicking "File" -> "Download" -> "Comma Separated Values (.csv)", and saved under the name "metadata.csv" in the `data/` directory.
